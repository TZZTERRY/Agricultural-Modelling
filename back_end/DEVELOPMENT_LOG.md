| Week 3 (12/08/2022) | 1. Familiar with the back-end development process, investigate the main web development frameworks, such as Flask, Django, Pyramid, etc.<br/>2. Organize logical ideas and use Postman software to write basic API documents |                                          | 1.we dicided to use Flask framework, as the following reasons: our predicted algorithm is writen by Python, and Flask is also writen by Python; Flask is light and easy to use, and it has higher flexibility,higher compatibility with latest technologies, and high scalability for simple web applications; moreover, our main goal for this project is to develop efficiently, rather than maintenance.<br/>2. We decided to use Postman as the following reasons: Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones we have made ourselves. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality. Besides that, Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster. | Risk for Flasks: 1. it has potential high security vulnerability; 2. flask framework has no CSRF protection.<br/>Risk for Postman: Postman is ealisy impacted by log4j2 vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | By doing related research, comparing the existing commonly used web development frameworks, and combining with the actual needs of our project, we finally decided to use the Flask framework. We deeply understand the importance of doing research, and although it takes a lot of time, it can help us on the right path. In addition, we also completed the development of API documentation and used it as a post-test. During this period, we learned how to develop APIs, set up ports, etc.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Week 4 (19/08/2022) | 1. Established a basic server and complete the server respone. 2. Write the common methods of get and post;3.Save the returned data in Jason format, and learn step by step to develop the database.                     |                                          | 1. We decided to use the web server development tool that comes with flask, since it makes the process of designing a web application simpler. Also, flask lets us focus on what the users are requesting and what sort of response to give back and learn more about micro frameworks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | we think Flask is not recommended for production because of stability rather than security. With WSGI or Gunicorn, we can utilize multi-thread/multi-proc more effectively, and serve multiple requests simultaneously. Besides that using more modules is seen as a third party involvement which could be a major breach in security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | We have completed the construction of the server with a small amount of code, which reduces our development cost and improves efficiency. In addition, we are also investigating which database to use to store the information, taking into account time and management costs. Next, we will write functions one after another to further process the obtained data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Week 5 (27/08/2022) | 1. Coding the service. 2. Run service on localhost. 3. Done research about different SQL/noSQL databases.  4. implemented function that get data from database and transfer Json file to Python object.                  |                                          | 1. We decided to use Amazon DynamoDb, the reason is DynamoDb has the benefit of auto-scaling, in-memory caching, backup and restore options. Besides that, it is free and reliable system, which can help us build event-driven architecture and user-friendly applications. Also, we decide to use commercial database rather than build one by ourselves since it saves our time so that we can focus on implementing other functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Through research, we found that DynamoDB has the problem that strongly consistent read is not applicable, indeed, only eventually consistent read is supported. Also, one of the tradeoffs of DynamoDB is that Sorting is not a great option. Besides, Text searching is limited and Pagination is hard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | This week, we have done the task like Coding the service, Run service on localhost, etc. When we were doing these tasks, we met the difficulties like how to choose a suitable database for our website. also, we need to think about what type of data we are going to store. we decided to transfer Json file into Python object, so that easy to code in future. next week, we will try to connect DynamoDB with our website and local server; prepare online testing through established API documents                                                                                                                                                                |
| week 6 (03/09/2022) | 1. Preliminarily set up for the DynamoDB database <br/> 2. stll learning how to design table on Dynamodb <br/>. 3. update the process on both Trello and Ganreet                                                         |                                          | 1. So far, we just build the framework of DynamoDB. we learned the matrieal through online tutorial, and we improve and design the database based on group' s discussion. Besides that, we also seek help from other team's help, and we do get beneficial suggestions from them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | During the process of designing databases, we consider the risk of Excessive privileges, Legitimate privilege abuse, and Database injection attacks. For instance, When workers are granted default database privileges that exceed the requirements of their job functions, these privileges can be abused, Gerhart said. “For example, <br/>a bank employee whose job requires the ability to change only account holder contact information may take advantage of excessive database privileges and increase the account balance of a colleague’s savings account.” Further, some companies fail to update access privileges for employees who change roles within an organization or leave altogether. | Design a database which is safe and easy to use, which is hard. we spend amount of time on discussing to design a suitable table for our project. but we finished our task on time. although we met the problem of how to design table efficently, which index should we use, after watchingrelevant tutorial, we have answers in our mind. we solve the questions by learing independently and ask help from classtames. for nexr week, we will build a useable databse, and test our established API documents.                                                                                                                                                         |
| week 7 (10/09/2022) | 1. Successfully established both local and remote database <br/> 2. briefly discussed the tables, and how we store the data                                                                                              |                                          | 1. we decided to not to public our access key and access ID, cause if we push to github, someone can easily enter our database, and change data; secondly, we decided to create several tables to store relevant data, since dynamoDB is nonSQL, and we create different tables, which is easy to locate and query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | as we said, we have risk of leaking access key and ID, the only thing we can do is to keep our sensitive information in our local computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | we have spent two weeks on establishing database, we have learned a lot through different tutorials. during the process, we have met many difficulties, such as how to set up dynamoDb locally, and how to create and read tables by using Python. while we sort out these issues by working together, we discuss and find the answers, tried many times, and finally we set up the database. in the next week, we will start on designing tables, we plan to create several tables such as temperature, humunidy and so on, which are based on the model features. the reason is DynamoDB is nonSQL, so that we can create different tables, and query them efficiently. |
| week 8 (17/09/2022) | 1. Create several tables based on the features that incorporated in the algorithm <br/> 2. communicate with front end to plan input data to server and design a special form of conveying data between front and back end|                                          | 1. we decided to create a mound of small tables for initially testing, the reason is our database has more than 5000 pieces of data, and we are new to server, so it can reduce risk to an extent. Also, we decided to use one account to manage database, so that there is no authentication issue, which save us a lot of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | when we create tables, there are many risks, such as Insider Threats, Exploitation of Database Software Vulnerabilities, SQL/NoSQL Injection Attacks, and Buffer Overflow Attacks, etc. so far, we plan to use a firewall to protect our database server from database security threats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | We are struggle with getting authentication for access to dynamoDB, however, we gave up in the end, we adopt one singe account which can simply our developing process. For next week, we plan to input the database and merge front and back end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| week 9 (24/09/2022) | 1.

Besides that, we decided to design a special form of conveying data between server and host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | during the process of transmitting data, we found that our backend has many potential risks, such as Data Injection, Access Control Misconfigurations, Software Misconfigurations, and Lack of Vulnerability Scanning. To solve these risks, we plan to encrypt sensitive data, and also try to Identify the data that requires extra protection and limit the accessibility to only a bunch of legitimate users only by enforcing key-based encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | We are still in this process, we met a lot of problems, such as how to design the form of convey data, and how to input large amount data in an efficient way. for next week, we will prepare the team video, and still work on this task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
