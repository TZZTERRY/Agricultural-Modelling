## Project Description

Predicting and understanding agricultural performance is highly important to help the Australian government make Australia a better country. The advent of climate change, the volatility of weather and the fluctuations of the market make agricultural predictions difficult, yet valuable. We want to create a platform usable by the Department of Agriculture, Water & Environment to predict the effect of these factors on yields, exports, efficiency and prices. The project will provide experience in utilising predictive AI, economic modelling and data analysis, as well as user centred design and implementation of a web based platform.

The outcome of the project includes the creation of a user-friendly platform that investigates historical weather data, agricultural yield data and economic price data using AI analysis tools, algorithms and data models to understand past impacts and forecast coming challenges in the country. 

We will examine multiple scenarios for future weather patterns to interpret their impacts on agricultural yields and economies while considering the implications of external factors such as climate change and COVID-19 pandemic. For example, The significant change to global temperatures due to climate change in recent years will inevitably impact on future agricultural yields. A calculated factor of future temperature rise will be added to the algorithm when predicting future agricultural yields.

The project starts by identifying and processing publicly available sources of data related to agricultural yield,exports, efficiencies and prices for chosen agricultural products (decided by TechLauncher team). Then:

- Create predictive models to estimate agricultural outputs and prices.
- Develop a user-friendly platform able to mode/process multiple scenarios and highlight the outcomes of future agricultural outputs.
- Investigate outliers within the data and highlight potential external affecting factors
